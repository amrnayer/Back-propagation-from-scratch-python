# Back-propagation-from-scratch-python
Implementing neural network back propagation training method by using python from scratch
# Backpropagation Algorithm
The Backpropagation algorithm is a supervised learning method for multilayer feed-forward networks from the field of Artificial Neural Networks.
# Iris dataset
This is the "Iris" dataset. Originally published at UCI Machine Learning Repository: Iris Data Set, this small dataset from 1936 is often used for testing out machine learning algorithms and visualizations (for example, Scatter Plot). Each row of the table represents an iris flower, including its species and dimensions of its botanical parts, sepal and petal, in centimeters.

>rows example: [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2],[4.9, 3. , 1.4, 0.2],[4.7, 3.2, 1.3, 0.2],[4.6, 3.1, 1.5, 0.2]
